    <h2>How to make chicken breast</h2>
    <p>You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's what you can expect when you make these simple baked chicken breasts: </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon coarse sea salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere's®), or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chicken broth, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to make chicken breast step-by-step</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle both sides with salt and Creole seasoning. <br> Place chicken in a broiler pan. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip chicken and cook until no <br>longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes more. <br>  An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
        <br>
        <li>Remove chicken to a plate. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Pour chicken broth into the pan and scrape any browned bits off the bottom with <br>a flat-edged wooden spatula. Add more broth if needed to dislodge the browned bits, but not too much or it will be watery. </li>
        <br>
        <li>To serve, drizzle the pan sauce over the chicken. </li>
    </ol>
